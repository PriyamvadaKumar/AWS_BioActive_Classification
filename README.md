# AWS_BioActive_classification


BioActive is an open-source package for generalizing the task of building a predictive model for an experimental space using Active Learning . 
Created 5 clusters with K-Means using the 14 different phenotypes from the dataset 
Clusters for each of the coordinates (Cell Line, Drug) were determined and was used as ground truth for BioActive. Further compared results with SVM 

AWS : S3 for data storage and EC2 for code retrieval and computation
